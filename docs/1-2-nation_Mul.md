# Kingdom of Mul

## Overview

Both Kingdoms of Mul were small kingdoms on the northern banks of the Mul River that exerted power and influence in their time over the regions that eventually became the Imperial Province of [Mulhong](2-1b-region_mulhong.md).

## First Kingdom of Mul

Not much is known about the first Kingdom of Mul, which existed until being conquered by the Old Indipian Empire. It is assumed to have been established by the nomadic Huldi people as they migrated from the east and established control over the indigenous tribes and petty kingdoms. The title "King of the Mul" continued to be employed by the Indipian Emperors though recognition of the historic kingdom itself faded over the generations.

## Second Kingdom of Mul

In -206 K.E. Czerk Hritte Lan I led a successful rebellion of the Mul nobles against the weakened control of the North Indip Empire. Years of economic downturn and over extraction of natural resources to feed the Indip heartland was enough for the regional nobles to align themselves with a growing Mul nationalism, even though many of the nobles were Indipian themselves. Following the expulsion of the nobles allegiant to the Emperor and a quick rebuke of the Imperial military allowed Czerk to be crowned King of the re-established kingdom. For a century of so, the kingdom was prosperous as it was able to take advantage of the prior investments by the Indip in the kingdom's resources to build wealth quickly. However, poor leadership and differences between the Mul and Indip nobility led to the kingdom weakening over time, even as the borders continued to expand north and east.

By the arrival of the Kaldrinic Empire, the Kingdom was a shell of it's former self and the royal house led by Queen Czenna Rizla III had little direct authority over the nobles. In 10 K.E., the Kaldrinic legions began mustering on the southern shore of the River Mul, preparing to cross over. A few small skirmishes later and Queen Czenna lay dead, struck down by an arrow from her own horse archers. Whether the arrow's trajectory was an accident, or was an intentional ploy to end the conflict before war really began is unknown. Regardless, the Queen's consort, Hrenn Rizla quickly settled with the Kaldrinic forces to allow the growing empire to annex the weak kingdom with minimal bloodshed. In return, Hrenn and the heir to Mul were permitted a seat on the Emperess's Close Council and a home in Ashenstone and their cities were spared the destruction and pillaging experienced in Indip the years prior.

As the Kingdom become absorbed into the new Imperial Provinces of [Mulhong](2-1b-region_mulhong.md), the once regionally powerful cities along the River Mul and the prowess of the Mul's horse archers became a footnote in history. The region continues to be a stable agricultural area, but little happens that garners attention on the international stage.
