## History
Lynnla has a long history of human, dwarven, and halfling inhabitance. Since the days of the old gods, it was a land of abundance and resources. In the centuries prior the arrival of the Kaldrinic Empire, the land was host to many pre-Tayn kingdoms. Over time as cultures, people, and nations melded eventually the more well-known Kingdom of Lynnla came to be. At it's zenith, the Kingdom covered most of the region, from the Bleak Coast, into parts of Gritia, and even included some overseas lands through conquest and marraige in Negarta and Cardaenon. By the arrival of the Kaldrinic Empire, Lynnla's borders had shrunk back down to south of the Isarick Mountains and out of Gritia. With the support of the Kaldrinic Legions, the Kingdom was able to re-expand the borders to include all of the Greenrock Mountains and the Bleak Coast, and by the dissolution of the Monarchy in 441 K.E. all of the lands north of Gritia and the Rift Water were considered within the Imperial Province of Lynnla.

## Geography
Lynnla can generally be divided into two main geography regions. The "lowlands" represent the gentle rolling hills and valleys along the Rift Water coast and north towards the Isarick Mountains. The "uplands" include the rugged, though not extremely tall, Greenrock and Isarick Mountains. The area between the two regions is referred to the "foothills".

The Mountain ranges are geologically part of the same ancient range, but the Greenrocks are older, softer rock leading to less severe peaks and broader river valleys. Both mountain ranges are speckled with various lakes, though the lakes in the Greenrocks tend to be larger. In general, the Isaricks are considered the harsher and colder of the two mountain ranges.

The City of Mines and surrounding dwarven communities were near the Greenrock Mountains, but geologically represented a distinct mountain division of harder, taller mountains.

North of the Isarick Mountains lay the Bleak Coast, a cold windswept region of exposed moors and rocky shorelines. 

Naturally, most of the region was an almost continuous blanket of deciduous temperate forest, becoming more boreal at the higher elevations and more northern portions of the mountains. Development has led to substantial portions of the lowlands being cleared for farmland, though between settlements the region is still known for its thick forested landscape.

The largest river in the region was the River Lynn, which flowed south from the Greenrock Mountains towards the Rift Water. The wide river valley and its many tributaries provided substantial fertile land perfect for permanent settlement.
