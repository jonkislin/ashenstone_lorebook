# Balnoorial

## Early History

Balnoorial began centuries before the establishment of the Kaldrinic Empire. It likely began as a fishing and trade outpost at the confluence of the West Lynn River and the Hieloth River. Over the centuries it grew as a central crossroads for regional travel in the upper Lynn Valley.

By around -700 K.E., the city functioned as the capital of the growing Kingdom of Balnoorial, which had then consolidated power in the Lynn Lowlands to become the predominant power in the region. It was around this time that the kingdom became the Kingdom of Lynnla, though Balnoorial remained the capital of the newly established region-wide kingdom. It would remain the capital for over 1000 years until relocated by the Kaldrinic Empire.
