## _Early Afternoon, Kaaterday, Aprel 16th, 443KE_

Well, let's see what's in this armory now that those enhanted cuirasses have been dismantled...

I pull from the wall:
- __Ancient Ekryptian Shortsword__

Darn pulls from a case:
- __Morningstar of the Fallen Mountain__
    - Goes to Boudicca

I feel bad that Darn has been shafted after ogling the Morningstar, so I give him the Ancient Ekryptian Shortsword. I'm going to open the next display case, Darn gets poisoned by dart... and then attacks me with the Ancient Ekryptian Shortword! What gives! Ouch! Thanks to Torin, he is once again crumpled on the floor. 

We use a mage hand and Steve the Unseen Servant to open the remaining cases:

- __Tome of Wizard Wishes__
    - Goes to Flim Flam
- __Gloves of the Fire Warden__
    - Goes to Hazar.

### The Upstairs Study?
In the next room, we find a woman, Clarice, under a net. We interrogate her, she's also under Gordro's employ. I cut out Clarice from under the net, and Torin smacks me! Ouch!!!

I go numb and sit on the floor with my lute.

Boudicca has three bronze rings? Dang. She's incorrigible. The elves of Kiv'La would've had her hands by now many time over.

Scrolls? I suppose I have a taste for this 'looting' thing myself. What's becoming to us here? Are we even on the right path? Morally speaking? Who are we? Grandfather would have never approved. 


### Clarice and the Poison Mist

Clarice opens a door and a poison gas fills the room. I am done with this. Healing myself up, I run up the stairs and cast dancing lights.

Up through a side room on the left, back through into a hallway, then through and a bollo wraps around my legs. 

### Jerrick Thorkalen and Gordro

Jerrick points a sword at me and asks who I am. I call his name and he is startled that I know it. 

Torin comes through, I tell him to put down his axe. Then Shaheila comes in and diffuses the situation. My bollo is removed. 

We share wine and speech. 

Jerrick tells us:
- He thought Shaheila and her son were dead.
- Chakri. How do we stop it. 
- He has Chakri's itinerary.

### Chakri's Itinerary

__Wegsdae Morning:__
- Chakri arrives.

__Wegsdae Afternoon:__
- In the Copper Keep with the Dutchess
- Holy mass of the Mother
- Cathedral on far side of bay.

__Wegsdae Evening:__
- Dinner with the Knights of the Valley.
- After-dinner, private appointment.

__Thyrsdae__:
- Military parade
- Sunset Mass at the Pantheon of the Family
- Evening gala at the Belt Theatre

Jerrick will put in a good word with ol Sir Darley Farlin.

## _Late Afternoon, Kaaterday, Aprel 16th, 443KE_

We leave for the Lizard Bachelor and take a long rest, where I am writing this now.

We go to bed.

## _Early Morning, Soonday, Aprel 17th, 443KE_

### The Lighthousers Call On Us

Ixor and Martin call us to meeting with Cherri in the Lizard Bachelor.
Eolbiyod allows us into Cherri's chambers. Martin and Eolbiyod are the only ones in here, apparently Martin and Cherri are friends. Ixor is outside keeping watch.

Martin shows us a map of Chakri's Parade Route.

Chakri's Lieutenant Marquil Lennick. Hmm. I don't know the name. But he will come in Monnday. 

Might we explode something? Might we catch him at the Gala?
Belt Theatre... 
Councillor Riggin has been involved in preparing for Chakri's arrival.

Explosives? I am not paying attention much.
I fear we've missed an opportunity to inform our friends in Wulda of a plan to take down a common enemy. 

Where are we going now? Somewhere to the docks? My head is swimming... a chance truly to take down the Beast?

## _Late Morning, Soonday, Aprel 17th, 443KE_

### Heading to the Docks

The Copper Keep. Ollie took our 20 gold. 
Grall waiting for us for an hour for an extra 5 gold. 

(Also - who died and made him Lord-Emperor?)

## _Midday, Sooonday, Aprel 17th, 443KE_

### Into the Copper Keep
Willem and Dorlia. Guards.
Loric, one of the Dutchess' advisors brings us through the ancient parts of the castle.

We meet the Dutchess Leylish. I mistake her for Shaheila.

Leylish will support us, she will not sacrifice too much to do so.. but she will help.

My brain is fuzzy. Somehow, having Chakri within my potential grasp has led me to lose my senses just a bit.  

What now? IF we succeed, then what? For the past seven years this has been among my strongest drives. 

I write this by the light of the tunnels under Copper Keep. 
Do we go back to talk to Cherri?

I put down my new Blue Jay quill down.
