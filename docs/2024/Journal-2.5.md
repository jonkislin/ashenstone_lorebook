# Epilogue - The Mysterious Glade and The Dead Mall

> Earth Date 1/10/2025.

## The Glade

Mysterious boulders... standing stones... symbols?
Flower?

What is this place?
"Is this heaven?" Hazar asks?  

A woman with long red hair and pointed here. 

"Is Ylysir with you?"  

The small lady compels me to drink.  


## The Dead Mall

We seemt o be in a plaza, or forum, indoors..? I've never seen such a thing. Somehow, the decor is both very futuristic while very very sad.

What... my shortbow did not function as intended..... it went on fire and chased me, Torin was able to dispatch the arrow... but the axe fell apart?

Lilian... what did you do to us?
Where are we?

- Lightsong pukes into the fountain
- Torin wins the claw game first try
- Brad comes with us.
- Lightsong screams and runs and slips on old Bath and Body Works soap
- Yeehaw Photos!
    - Black vest, tan jacket.
    - Bolo ties???
    - I have no idea what's going on.
- The axe is sad. 

*Lightsong is distraught*  

1. Spirit halloween everyone gets a picture frame, Boudicca picks it out. 
2. The stock photo is Hazar, his mom, and Lord Chakri. 
3. Music store, guy restrings the lighter strings on Thorvir's lute. 
4. The rest of the crew buys tshirts. 
5. A "payphone" rings and its a voice I remember. Who....

Sister.

Burlingtone Coat Factory.

Bring bring bring

Hazar and I are not doing well

Oh, they made a fire.

JOHNNY ROCKETS.

ARIA IS HERE. SPEAKING IN HALF-ORCISH.
YOU

A being of the highest magical order needs to lay down their life for me.. and for Aria.
Fi'arie is... sexy dancing? What. What.
The axe tells us we must blow a bubble with a treat and make Flim Flam die.
I blow a bubble... and flim flam vanishes. I guess he's dead? Flim Flam!
We get on the Carousel. There's a dead wizard. I sit on him.

## Back in the Glade
Sticky hands... and we're back in the glade.

This isn't a regular sky... it's actually night time in reality, this is magical sunlight. 

FLIM FLAM.

- Is flam flam alive?
- Is lightsong gonna die?
- Is hazar a pirate?
- What's with Torin's axe?

There's darkness across the city, Laighfuar, lights flickering, screaming, ghosts.

At this point a plague of shadowy figures has fallen upon the city of Laighfuar. 

> Where the characters head off to at the conclusion of the campaign.
> - Lightsong heads for Wulda.
> - Hazar is wandering aimlessly toward the Sea. Thousand yard stare.
> - Torin takes the axe and heads home and knows what happened... why there is darkness spreading across the land. 
> - Boudicca is going back to her Dwarven home in Lynnla. City of Mines. Boudicca finds she's an heiress to the powerful political powers. 
> - Flim Flam was never heard of again
