# Session 3 - May 21st 2025

- Bolete: Sick? Off on her own? Not sure. We're sure she'll come back eventually.
- Crooked Cornucopia. Boudicca and Torin are awoken by a noise. Boudicca goes back to sleep.
- Torin and Indarhan hear eldritch whispers of Elaynnu? (sp?)
- Torin, Indarhan, and Boudicca confront Felu about his grandfather Ilyenu.
- Shifty came to break up the tension. Now we're planning to go to the Desert.
- Bolete is out foraging. She won't be joining us.
- We hit the road. A fell weather falls upon us. Very dark. Very ominous.
- We find the Warehouse, where J'ruq Oldebags will meet us.
- Two Mules - Jeff and GeOff. Shifty leads us into the Warehouse, a former church. 
- Felu does a Detect Planar Portal and finds that a Graxil portal is VERY close, in the basement, even.
- Out from the basement an old friend - Lightsong - comes. We roll initiative. He's possessed. Ruh roh. (Oh no!)

## Battle - Lightsong, Darkmoon Host
- Lightsong summons Hazar, Spectral Rogue.
- Boudicca kills Felu with the Songhew. The Songhew sucks in Felu's blood. The Deadmoon releases Lightsong for a second, and Lightsong expresses regret at what's happening. 
- Felu: "We tried our best. You must destroy the Graxil, not just seal them away. I hope I have redeemed myself, if only a little."
- Torin's axe glows and revives Felu, but puts him into stasis. He is unconscious.
- The party suffers a curse from Boudicca: 
    - -10 to persuasion rolls against Half-Orcs and Elves. Half-Orcs and Elves will view the party with contempt/hostility/suspicion.
- Indarhan gets two drops: The Darkmoon Bow (hits Graxil back +15 feet) and the Dayspurned Dagger (15 ft sneak attack, Holy damage at night, Dagger +1).
