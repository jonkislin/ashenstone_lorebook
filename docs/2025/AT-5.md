# Session 5 - June 19th 2025

## In the Armory of Ingwë

Ingwë the armorer, his niece Indis, and Indis' betrothed Finwë take the party in.
Ingwë, as it turns out, had a talk with Mayor Renip of Indip and this calmed the commotion when the party came in. Somehow, they are not affected by Boudicca's cursemark, which gives the party disadvantage on charisma based checks.

The party is fed a meal of mushroom stew and Tambas Bread.

Ingwe is a distant relation of Flim-Flam the Lost's grandfather.
The party has a long rest.

Bolete realizes that the glowing red stone she found from Felu was a homing beacon, after talking with Finwe, Ingwe, and Indis.

## Destroying the Tracking Beacon; the Mystery of the Cats of Izÿ

Bolete realizes she must destroy the tracking Beacon. She has her salamander familiar throw it in Lake Mulhong.

While she does this, Torin accompanies her and sees exactly forty-two kittens, one of whom has a glowing blue crystal sprouting from her tail.

## Attacked by the Deepseeker Ildarii

Hearing a scream, the party rushes back to Ingwë's armory. The forge-room is clothed in a magical darkness. It relents to reveal some Elves in battle gear - Lord Galdrion and a strike group of Deepseeker Ildarii (a clan of ancient Elves) has waylaid and incapacitated poor Ingwe and Indis. The Party and Finwe rush in and a battle ensues. These Deepseekers are Felu's kin. They wipe Ingwe and Indis's memory and one Deepseeker, Galdrion's niece Sylphrena (whom we found out was Felu's cousin - making Galdrion Felu's father) makes off with Felu, still in a stasis.

The party defeats the Deepseekers Astel and Alarin, the vanguard. When defeated, a purple lattice appears on each of their bodies and cracks. Galdrion, overseeing and seemingly impervious to attack, vanishes in a puff of dark-purple magics, smugly telling the party that they will "Make fine vessels." He never seemed to be bothered during the fight, speaking perhaps to his power.

The party rushes outside of Ingwe's smithy/armory to find three dead Unhorned (half-orcs):

- Tinker (who sold Bianca to Indarhan)
- Steve (who was possessed by Elyssa)
- J'ruq (who decided not to join the party after the encounter with a moon-possessed Lightsong and Boudicca's cursemark.)
