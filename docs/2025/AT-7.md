# Session 7 - July 27th 2025

We arrive in the Gold Desert, travelling at unfathamoable speeds. The stars streak brilliantly above.
Myr leads the way, step by step. 
The sand below is like glass...

## Outside the Temple

The party notes astronomical imagery, including the living moon Aldarma and the dead moon Neara. 
There is one inscription on each pillar framing the enterance. On the left: "Aldarma". On the right: "Neara," atop something older, scratched out. Indarhan attempts to discover what it was, but cannot make it out.

## Entering the Temple

- The party enters the temple, dragging Jeff (Geoff was left behind) and Grimble, asleep against Jeff's back, into the antechamber.

`Only Aldarma's Aria can Quiet Neara's Nocturne`

## The party is split

- Shifty arrives in a cage with Tinker shooting at him and saying "why'd you leave me behind Shifty?! were you gonna grab the treasure all yourself?"
- Indarhan arrives in an underground room with a spike trap and a Spectral Hazar who attempts to pickpocket him.
- Boudicca meets her ancestor in a seaside cave.
- Torin has to fight two Graxil atop a battlement, also at the sea side.
- Bolete does not disappear.

## Bolete discovers Captain Yew of the North Indip Fleet

- Rolled up against the door that bars the path further into the temple, is an unconscious man in an imperial Naval Uniform.
- Bolete heals him and he returns to consciousness.

## Bolete discovers Aldarma's Aria

- `F`-`G`-`E` can quell the Graxil.
