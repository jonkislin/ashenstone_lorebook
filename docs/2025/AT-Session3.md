# Recap to re-motivate the Campaign

## The Shadow Plague: A Legacy Unfolding

Over thirty years ago, your party faced and defeated the monstrous being Chakri. But that victory came with a cost none of you foresaw.
In the aftermath, cities fell into chaos. Dark spirits—Graxil—rose from the depths of the earth, spreading death and madness. Lauge Fuir, once the empire’s gem, was overrun. The group split, each hero retreating to defend their homelands. The world changed forever.
Now known as the Shadow Plague, the darkness spread far and wide. Civilization pulled inward. Trade faltered. Underground kingdoms collapsed. Entire regions became wastelands crawling with the undead and worse.

But something ancient has begun to stir.

Whispers from a forgotten weapon—an ancestral axe—hint at a way to end the plague. It speaks of a sister shard to the fallen moon, a relic tied to the origin of the Graxil. Old records point south to Indep, a land of half-orc shamans who may hold the key.
You and a few trusted allies now march south, through lawless wilderness and haunted ruins, seeking answers and redemption. The Graxil are not merely a scourge to be fought—they are a curse that can be undone.

Your mission is clear:

    Find the sister moon shard. Uncover the truth of the Graxil. End the Shadow Plague.

The road will be brutal. But this may be your last chance to undo the horrors your victory helped unleash—and to save the world from the darkness you once awoke.

## Last Session

The party awoke at the Inn to find Felu communicating with his kin via magics you found dark. 
This arose your suspicions.
As you headed out for the Desert, you received mail. Boudicca - a letter from Shaheila urging you to get Felu's blood.
Dr Stone received lore on the Deadmoon.
Additionally, Lightsongs old Axe appeared with the letters, with an inscription.
The sister Moon Shard, through some machination unknown to you, possessed your old compatriot Lightsong.
He attacked as you were meeting Shifty and his guard at the waypoint.
Lightsong summoned your other old compatriot Hazar. 
He was far too strong, until Boudicca slew Felu with the Songhew Axe.
