## 1/28/25 - Session 0 Synopsis

- Torin (Matt), Boudicca (Charlotte), and three Dwarven companions (NPCs) encounter a druid, Bolete (Adam), and a professor of antiquities, Indarma Jones (Mike). All parties are mutually suspicious at first.
- They are soon overrun by Graxil.
- A young Ildarii, Fëlu of Jezier'Raïk (Jon), comes from the shadows to assist, having been on the trail of the Graxil since earlier that day.
- The band of Graxil is defeated. Boudicca and Torin tell of their plan to find another splinter of the Deadmoon to see if they can "plug the leak." Fëlu admits his task is aligned, and would also like to find a certain blue Dramcursed Tiefling for his role in the release of the Graxils, also suspecting his new Dwarvish companions as complict.
- Bolete's and Indarma's motivations are less clear, but they seem generally willing to travel with the new group.
