| -982 | The High Orcish Necromancer-kings L'ratomi and Z'ratomi begin The Inquistion of the Horns, , triggering the great Northward migration of the Unhorned along the Western rim of the Gold Desert.

| -904 | *Trag Çom Anatala I* declares the Ley-Indip-Ley or Indipian Empire, upon the death of her father, the Fu-Ley of Mulloch-Izyal. Anatala adopts the title Fu-Indip-Ley ("First Servant of Indip's land"), which becomes the title for all Indipian Emperors and Empresses until the collapse of the Empire. | ![anatala](images/people/anatala.png) | 
| -834 | The City of Invëye is founded on the southern coast of Indip. It quickly grows to be the largest in Indip and the known world, becoming known as Great Invëye. | |

Mysteriously, this event coincides with the final Darkening of the Watergates hundreds of miles south in Great Invëye, leaving South Indip without its historical naval trump-card. | |
| -204 | Founding of Izÿ on Lake Mulhong by refugees from Indïdip. | |
|   -4 | The dual catastrophy of the eruption of Mount Iljo and the breaking of the Gods' Dam lead to the migration of Emperor Jontosin and his people north by ship to find new lands. The Denisians, also impacted by the catastrophy, begin to migrate north too. | |
|   -3 | Emperor Jontosin's fleet is attacked by Orcs from the Rock Hills. Emperor Jontosin's flagship suffers damage, and his youngest daughter, Kalina, is killed. | |
