### Character Backlore

Fëlu hails from the ancient Elven city of Jezier'Raïk and is a Fledgling *Deepseeker*.

While most adept with a bow, he has recently been learning the art of the glaive, and has inherited his grandfather Ilyenu's Moon-touched Deepseeker Glaive of yore.

His primary goal is to hunt as many Graxil as possible and locate splinters of Morě-Duar (the Deadmoon), thereby proving himself to the Deepseeker High Council. He has also been tasked with a secondary mission - to hunt and bring back to Jezier'Raïk a certain blue Dreamcursed suspected of playing a role in the resurgence of the Graxils.

Fëlu is quite good at hunting both Graxils and people if necessary, but not particularly adept at socializing.
