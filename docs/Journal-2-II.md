## _Thyrsdae, Aprel 14th, 443 KE_

### Confronting Cherri, with Hawk Vorplen in tow
My salubrious companions and I decided to accompany Hawk Vorplen to his 
mistress, Cherri, who had sent us toward Hawk and the Lizard Bachelor.

My fellow squisher, Flim Flam, is quite exhausted at this point. I was too, you know.
We get back to the Elm Snake and chat with the bouncer shortly and jovially before
he lets us in.

### Cherri's Place at the Elm Snake
- Girish Grog. Half orc.
- Hawk Vorplen.
- Cherri gives us 10 platinum a piece.
- Coalition of Dwarven Artisans - shall we check them out?

A good long rest! Finally!

## _Furdae, Aprel 15th, 443 KE - Morning_

We took a good rest. I feel better, at least physically. 
Tea and porridge with some sugar in it. They didn't have any sweetrolls. 
A always loved sweetrolls. Extra sugar will do.

Shaheila magic yelled 'approach' to Hazar.

We then discussed next steps.

Shaheila put a boon on my corporeal form. If I would go down in combat, 
I would instead be left with a thread of consciousness. (_1 hp when would go to zero, one time use_)

We walk toward Cherri to finish business. 

Cherri says Chakri is coming to Laighfuar this upcoming week.
They're going to hold a military parade.

THE THIRD LEGION OF THE BOAR - TREE KILLERS.

SHAHEILA MUST KNOW.

Hazar is a bit of a wimp. Doesn't want to infiltrate.

### To the old man and the dinghy (The Blue Flame)

We do the rigamaroll with the lantern. Into the Dinghy with the old man we go!
He's quaint. I don't remember his name. Sometimes old folks like him have more to them than you'd think.
He's surprisingly strong for how utterly frail he looks.

Coastream! The blue door! 6 up the road. Blue Lantern.

### At the Lighthouser's Outpost, in Coastream
We meet Mindelrian. He's a lad of the Lighthouser's guild.
The Lighthousers! I should've known they'd be here. They're everywhere in the Empire.
Ixor (mage) was mentioned. Hmm. Curious.
Looks like the Boat Man forgot to give us a key or something.

Ellbeyod Ovrianiah (or, however those silly Elves spell it), 
a more senior member, the Poisoner, I think he said? Interesting, I suppose.

We're in the Lighthouser's Outpost of Laighfuar.
Martin Dersheneviet, human, is the Guildmaster of the local chapter.
We strike a deal to meet the Dutchess in council.

The quartermaster Ninemriard has weapons we can purchase.
Thurysso barges in. Martin simmers him down.

#### _Buying from Ninemriard_
From Ninemriard I bought a rabbit's foot. The other items were too expensive.

#### _Hazar's Reveal_
Ixor recognized Hazar. We learned that Hazar used to be a Lighthouser, interesting!
Left in disgrace after his rival killed his lover. He played Dead. 
Then he actually died and came back with us. How fun.

#### _We ask Ixor for help_
Hazar asks Ixor to get Martin to help us case the joint. 
Ellbeyod Ovrianiah knows we want some spicy poisonwares. 
He will concoct some things for when we next chat. 

I put down my quill for now - it seems that we are amassing some unexpected but welcome alllies.
