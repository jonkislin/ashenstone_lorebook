My journal pen will be light these next few days. I must focus on our quest here. 

## _Sooonday_

- We debate, in the Lizard Bachelor, how best to kill him. The beast that has haunted us. We've almost got him!
- My mind continues to be hazy. What is this? I must be in better shape...
- Marquil, the right hand mand of the beast, is coming Monday to scout ahead. 

The Elf wizard suggests a plan:
- Start a riot in the main town, Wednesday night, city hall. 
- Once some portion of the army moves into the city, blow it up half way. 
- We are meanwhile undercover in the castle. 
- Hazar suggests we use a proxy. 

_We go to sleep for the night_

## _Moonday_

Cherri wakes Torin and I up, around 8 in the morning. 
Yuwelion and Grenlo walk in. We wake up the rest of the party and beckon them in. 

What might they want?

Aha! I am given a necklace of Regeneration. This should come in handy. 
Flim Flam is given a six inches ring. Unnaturally natural. Made with Elven Hands. I smile. 

I eavesdrop on Grenlo telling the Dwarves about the Grillix (???).
Torin headbutts me. Hard. VERY HARD. 

Hazar tells Cherri about his mom being made a wench by the beast. Well. That was hard to listen to. 
Drinn cocktails. Well. 

Cherri likes power vacuums. Noted. 

Marcus will let us into where Marquil is staying at the Golden Throne. 

Everyone hides in Marquil's closet.
We short rest.

I am there, playing for him. We have a good conversation with a Cryth and my Lute. 

We take Lord Marquil on adventure into the tunnels. 
We sneak attack him, tie him, and take his stuff with us. 
We get a paper. Interesting religious iconography. I take his Cryth. 

300 gold for explosive expert to set chargees on the bridge at 10:30pm.

We confer back with Cherri to talk about final details. 

_We now take a long rest._

## __Teezday__

We wake up, feeling recharged.
We go talk to the ol' boatman, where Hazar tells our boatman to do things.  
Doran Jackqiwill. Yes.
Tomorrow night slash Thyrsday.

Ok, copper keep. Willem? Guards. I don't care. 

We confront Shaheila of the Corracks' livery in the harbor. 

Chakri has interest in the Graxil not being fought. 

Shaheila wants to know of her son. 

Back to the Lizard Bachelor and Cherri for one last night. 

__Go to bed__

## __Teezday Evening__

Well, with incredible anxiety I report that I woke up this morning from an Ash-blasted Dream!
I haven't had one of those since I was very very little, before I turned. 
I had forgotten what the experience was like, but there's no mistaking this.

They say we Dreamcursed only dream the month of our deaths...

```
I dream of a dark cave...

CRYING, PAIN, JOY, FEAR, ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.
I CRAWL THROUGH THE CAVE, LOOKING FOR LIGHT.
A BLINDING WHITE SNOWSCAPE OPENS IN FRONT OF ME.

I SEE A YOUNG WOMAN, HOODED, HUNCHED OVER, CRYING. 
SHE - YOU! - ARE CRYING.
NEVER CAN I GET ANY CLOSER. 

THE SNOW TURNS TO SALTY TEARS.

THE LIGHTNING TURNS TO SALTY TENDRILS.

YOU ARE... PROTECTED? SOMEHOW.
DARK CLOUD ENVELOP YOU.
LAUGHTER. MANLY LAUGHTER...

TWO FIGURES - DWARF SHAPED CLOUDS. I TRY TO REACH THEM TOO,
BUT RED FIERY PLUMES THROW ME BACK THROUGH THE SNOW. 
BACK INTO THE CAVE. BACK INTO THE HARD ROCKY EARTH.

As I awake, I hear stalwart voices say:
"BROTHER FEAR NOT, WE'LL MAKE SURE SHE IS SAFE."

```

Oh Gods of the Wilds, he couldn't have gotten through even the _Seershadows_, could he?
Fi'ariÃ«, I know you're ancient beyond ancient by our standards, but I do hope you know what you're up against.
Three thousand years and you haven't failed yet...
