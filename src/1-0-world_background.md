Known for high quality metallurgy and stonework.
Has a substantial number of surface settlements inhabited by dwarves, halflings, and some humans.  

### City of Stone

- Based out of the eastern end of Wulda
- Relatively small city, inhabited mostly by dwarven refugees from the abandoned dwarven cities to the west
- Very isolationist

### City of Light

- In the mountains north of Sygassas.
- Named so for the unique fact that most of the current city is carved into the faces of mountains, allowing natural light not found in other dwarven cities.  
- The older depths of the city are sparsely inhabited and used for utilitarian purposes like mining, manufacturing, and storage.
- Is the only official Mountain Dwarf city that permits entrance into the city by any approved visitors, rather than restricting access to only Mountain Dwarves.
- Has a long-standing mutual relationship with Sygassas.

### City of Tunnels

- A relatively small city by dwarven standards. Have a focus on trade and production of luxury goods.  
- Name relates to the sprawling network of tunnels that form the backbone of the city and that extend for miles in all directions. It is claimed these tunnels connect to other dwarven cities or hidden entrances in other places of importance.  
- Very few surrounding surface settlements, instead nearby hill dwarves live among human-dominated settlements.

### City of Spires

In the mountains between Korren and the Marrow Mires.  

This city has long controlled the mountain pass between Korren and the east, and has been able to use that to control the movement of goods and people east-west (for a fee of course).

- Name refers to the massive stalactites that are found throughout the natural caverns that most of the city is built within.  

- Known for the export of their specially cultivated strain of cave mushrooms that are a delicacy throughout the world.  

There are numerous smaller dwarven cities throughout the lands. There are also a scattering of hill dwarf settlements on the fringes of human lands.  

There are many abandoned dwarven cities throughout the lands. Some have been reclaimed by others, but most are inhabited only by the ghosts of history. The reason for abandonment varies, but is never discussed due to the associated feelings of shame and failure by dwarves. Human settlements that make use of part or all of an abandoned dwarf city include:

- Highcliff
- Stonklin
- Palace of the Pointed Crownm
