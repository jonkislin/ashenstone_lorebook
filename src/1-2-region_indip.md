# Region: Indip

Very much a work in progress. Please don't mind the horrible run on sentences and conflicting information. I'm working on it iteratively :).

Adam:
> My vision for Indip (I'm not wedded to the name by the way) is that it's among the most loyal and "Imperialized" provinces, most of the original cultures having been assimilated, but also have impacted what modern Imperial culture looks like. In my head I see something based a little off of eastern asian cultures in terms of the aesthetic, but by no means a copy-paste of medieval China or Japan. More-so less traditional medieval European.
Indip is one of the oldest Imperial Provinces, having been among the first of the "Old Kingdoms" to fall to the Kaldrinic Dynasty in year 7 K.D. (Ekrypt was first, in year 4 K.D. Before the arrival of the Kaldrinic Empire, Indip was a separate empire that spanned modern Indip, large portions of the Rock Hills, and southeastern portions of modern Mulhong. However, the empire's hey-day was long past and thus made an easy target for the newer, stronger Kaldrinic Empire.
Drimmharbor was founded by Admiral Hiro Drimm in 6 K.D. as a major shipyard for the Kaldrinic Empire. Following the fall of the Indipian Empire it was designated the Provincial Capital of the new Kaldrinic holdings on the east side of the Jewel Sea (provinces would not be organized until 36 K.D.). It still is the home of the main Imperial Shipyard and a major trade hub.
The Palace of the Pointed Crown is built deep into the mountains (unnamed) in the east part of Indip. This is the headquarters of the Church of the Pointed Crown (think the Vatican), built atop the ruins of an older Indipian temple monastery. It functions more like a small city.
Old Indipian Capital - somewhere in Indip. Still exists, but is less important than Drimmharbor. No details yet!

## Summary
Indip is one of the oldest Imperial provinces. Interestingly, Indip as a whole is often thought of as a backwater, despite its more central location geographically. The capital of Indip, Drimmharbor, is home to the vast imperial navy fleets and is anything but a backwater. Being less than a half-day's boat ride from Ashenstone, Drimmharbor is very cosmopolitan, and many forget that the __Drimmharbor District__  is not a top-level imperial province itself.

The name "Indip" is a shortened Kaldrinic variant of the pre-imperial outpost _Lz Ïndip'ey Ah_ (_Lz_ - "beside" _Ïndip_ - "deep water" _'ey_ - first person plural possessive modifier, _Ah_ - "clear or light"), in the Centre-Coastal Half-Orc dialect. Now long ruled by the Empire, the former "Lz Ïndip'ey Ah" is now the site of the Drimmharbor Quays, a vast system of naval drydocks and manufactories under strict Martial Law. (The water is no longer clear).

### Districts of Indip
The empire divides Indip into three coastal districts and one "extension":
1. The Mulmarch (farmland to the north of Drimmharbor, up to the border of Mulhong)
2. Drimmharbor District (central coast)
3. Iveénland (farmlands and wetlands on the southern Indipian coast, named for the Iveéndip River)
4. Indip Extension (the vast interior of Indip, "extending" to the Gold Desert)

- __Drimmharbor__ - capital, site of the Royal Navy Yards, the Royal Navy Academy, and home to the headquarters of the famously flamboyant _Lighthousers Guild_, one of the rare organizations politically savvy enough to have a strong presence in both Imperial and non-Imperial provinces.
- __Drimmharbor Quays__ - Navy operated satellite city of Drimmharbor. Site of the vast imperial drydocks and manufactories. The area is under strict martial law at all times. Rigorous system of checkpoints prevents unauthorized entry despite its massive size. Notably absent of Orcs and half-orcs. In recent years, vast shipments of enormous logs have been reported, though officials maintain silence on the matter.
- __Drez'Dip__ - "Near deepwater" - Half-orcs were historically pushed out of the areas immediately surrounding Drimmharbor, their claimed ur-heimat, and as such the largest Half-orc town remaining in Indip is __Drez'dip__, on the Northern coast of the Inbay. Expanded fishing rights granted in reforms of recent decades have slightly improved the fortunes of the population, but there is still much poverty and resentment.
- __Inpoint__ - a very wealthy beach town dominated by Naval Academy elites. Opulent.
- __Cape Drimm__ - a small but popular destination for relaxation and hobby fishing. Fresh seafood caught daily by human and half-orc fishermen. Despite existing road and land access, most visit by boat to avoid the activity and checkpoints around the Quays. Private sea-side roads lead directly here from __Inpoint__.
- __Ashwatch Point__ - a small but elegant town across the Great Indip Sound from Drimmharbor. Site of the Ashwatch Lighthouse, pride of the Lighthouser's Guild. The Ashwatch Lighthouse houses an observatory from which the Lighthousers claim they can view both the stars and the towers of Ashenstone across the Jewel Waters.

### A brief history of Indip
The region now known to the Kaldrinic Empire as "Indip" was previously part of the Old Indipian Empire, and before that, a site of two waves of Half-orc migrations. It is said the lands were also important to the Elves, but most cosmopolitan elvish communities report not knowing much about Indip.

Indip is a Kaldrinic shortening of Old Indipian _Ley-Indip-Ley_, "Great Land of Indip," or literally "Land of Indip Land,"  _Ley-Indip-Ley_ is itself a corruption of the much older half-orc name _Lz Ïndip'ey Ah_, or "Beside Deepwater [that is] Ours, Clear". Thus, the word _Ïndip_ means literally "Deepwater," likely referring to the crater-sea now called the Inbay, the deepest known waters in the Empire.  

(_Yå'lv_, for the curious, is the word for shallow water ("waist-wet"), the old Half-Orc language having no word simply "water," using instead the word _Gerz'lv_ meaing "life-wet" for water that is imbibed.) This name _Lz Ïndip'ey Ah_ refers to the alleged home harbor of the Half-orcs, which Half-orc elders insist is now the site of the Drimmharbor Quays. 

Historically, the region now know as Indip contained the largest population of Half-orcs, being at the crossroads of the Orc strongholds in the Rock Hills and the Human settlements in Mulhong. The vast majority of Half-orcs clearly came as refugees from the south and were gracefully incorporated into the Indipian empire which expanded out of the North. However, it is said that the first Half-orcs in recorded history originated from the area surroudning what is now Drimmharbor, and the refugees came seeking this even more ancient refuge once more, and that some very old lineages of half-orc lived there when the new wave of refugees arrived shortly before the dawn of the Old Indipian Empire. 

Half-orcs were generally respected members of the Indipian Empire, and while they were required to pay taxes and pay homage to the Fu-Indip-Ley ("First of Indip-Land", i.e. the Emperor), they were treated with respect by the Old Indipian Dynasties, who adapted the name of the Half-orc settlement (not in appropriation, but in homage) and considered them holy people. After the fall of the old Indipian Empire to the Kaldrinic Empire, the rights of half-orcs diminished steadily. Over four centuries of Imperial dominion, humans have replaced much of the naturalized and native Half-Orc population, at least on the coast, though sizeable "uncontacted" half-orc populations are said to exist in the poorly surveyed interior, themselves said to be either remnants of the original native Half-orcs or rewilded bands of Half-orc refugees fleeing Imperial persecution. 

Elves, while historically a fleeting presence in the lands now know as Indip, are increasingly plentiful, both on the coast and in the interior, and seem not to have suffered much under the Empire. In recent decades, rumors of large-scale logging for the Empire's navy (the Empire is famously secretive as to where it sources raw materials), have soured the Elves, Half-elves, and Half-orcs even in places like Drimmharbor and Drez-dip, far from the alleged extractions.

In present times, the quality of life for Humans (and for many Elves and Half-elves) in the Drimmharbor area ranks among the highest in the Empire, especially among the well-educated elite affiliated with the Drimmharbor Naval Academy and Imperial Navy. Thus, despite a burgeoning movement of resentful nature-lovers and tree-worshippers, public support for the Empire is arguably higher in the cosmpolitan population of Indip than even in Ashenstone itself.
