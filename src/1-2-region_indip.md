## Summary
Indip is one of the oldest Imperial provinces. Interestingly, Indip as a whole is often thought of as a backwater, despite its more central location geographically. The capital of Indip, Drimmharbor, is home to the vast imperial navy fleets and is anything but a backwater. Being less than a half-day's boat ride from Ashenstone, Drimmharbor is very cosmopolitan, and many forget that the __Drimmharbor District__  is not a top-level imperial province itself.

The name "Indip" is a shortened Kaldrinic variant of the pre-imperial outpost _Lz Ïndip'ey Ah_ (_Lz_ - "beside" _Ïndip_ - "deep water" _'ey_ - first person plural possessive modifier, _Ah_ - "clear or light"), in the Centre-Coastal Half-Orc dialect. Now long ruled by the Empire, the former "Lz Ïndip'ey Ah" is now the site of the Drimmharbor Quays, a vast system of naval drydocks and manufactories under strict Martial Law. (The water is no longer clear).

### Districts of Indip
The empire divides Indip into three coastal districts and one "extension":
1. The Mulmarch (farmland to the north of Drimmharbor, up to the border of Mulhong)
2. Drimmharbor District (central coast)
3. Iveénland (farmlands and wetlands on the southern Indipian coast, named for the Iveéndip River)
4. Indip Extension (the vast interior of Indip, "extending" to the Gold Desert)

### A brief history
The region now known to the Empire as "Indip" was previously not organized under a single name, and is thought to have been sparesely populated for most of its history. Historically, it contained the largest population of Half-orcs, being at the crossroads of the Orc strongholds in the Rock Hills and the Human settlements in Mulhong. Over four centuries of Imperial dominion, humans have replaced much of the native Half-Orc population, at least on the coast, though sizeable "uncontacted" half-orc populations are said to exist in the poorly surveyed interior. Elves, while historically a fleeting presence in the lands now know as Indip, are increasingly plentiful, both on the coast and in the interior, and seem not to have suffered much under the Empire. In recent decades, rumors of large-scale logging for the Empire's navy (the Empire is famously secretive as to where it sources raw materials), have soured the Elves, Half-elves, and Half-orcs even in places like Drimmharbor, far from the alleged extractions.

In present times, the quality of life for Humans (and for many Elves and Half-elves) in the Drimmharbor area ranks among the highest in the Empire, especially among the well-educated elite affiliated with the Drimmharbor Naval Academy and Imperial Navy. Thus, despite a burgeoning movement of resentful nature-lovers and tree-worshippers, public support for the Empire is arguably higher in the cosmpolitan population of Indip than even in Ashenstone itself.
