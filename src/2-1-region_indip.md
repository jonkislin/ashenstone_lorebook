Very much a work in progress. Please don't mind the horrible run on sentences and conflicting information. I'm working on it iteratively :).

Adam:
> My vision for Indip (I'm not wedded to the name by the way) is that it's among the most loyal and "Imperialized" provinces, most of the original cultures having been assimilated, but also have impacted what modern Imperial culture looks like. In my head I see something based a little off of eastern asian cultures in terms of the aesthetic, but by no means a copy-paste of medieval China or Japan. More-so less traditional medieval European.
Indip is one of the oldest Imperial Provinces, having been among the first of the "Old Kingdoms" to fall to the Kaldrinic Dynasty in year 7 K.D. (Ekrypt was first, in year 4 K.D. Before the arrival of the Kaldrinic Empire, Indip was a separate empire that spanned modern Indip, large portions of the Rock Hills, and southeastern portions of modern Mulhong. However, the empire's hey-day was long past and thus made an easy target for the newer, stronger Kaldrinic Empire.
Drimmharbor was founded by Admiral Hiro Drimm in 6 K.D. as a major shipyard for the Kaldrinic Empire. Following the fall of the Indipian Empire it was designated the Provincial Capital of the new Kaldrinic holdings on the east side of the Jewel Sea (provinces would not be organized until 36 K.D.). It still is the home of the main Imperial Shipyard and a major trade hub.
The Palace of the Pointed Crown is built deep into the mountains (unnamed) in the east part of Indip. This is the headquarters of the Church of the Pointed Crown (think the Vatican), built atop the ruins of an older Indipian temple monastery. It functions more like a small city.
Old Indipian Capital - somewhere in Indip. Still exists, but is less important than Drimmharbor. No details yet!

## Summary
Indip is one of the oldest Imperial provinces, containing most of the former Old Indipian Empire. Interestingly, Indip as a whole is now often thought of as a backwater, despite its more central location geographically and Old Indip's historical superlative wealth and might. The current capital of Indip, __Drimmharbor__, is home to the Imperial Navy Fleet. 

Being less than a half-day's boat ride from Ashenstone, __Drimmharbor__ is as cosmopolitan as __Ashenstone__ itself. The size and wealth of Drimmharbor lead many to forget that the greater __Drimmharbor District__  is not itself a top-level province of the Empire, and most Ashenstonians never mention "Indip" by name, instead referring to the region as a whole as Drimmharbor or Drimmland.

## Districts of Indip

### Overview
Ashenstone's Imperial Land Ministry divides Indip into three coastal "districts" and the unorganized "East Indip Expanse":

1. __The Mulmarch__. Agricultural region north of Drimmharbor, extending up to the border of Mulhong. The original homeland of the Human nomads who eventually coalesced and formed the Old Indip Empire. _Indïdip_ ("Over-Indip"), the historic capital of the Old Indipian Empire is located here, on the south shore of Lake Mulloch. Briefly the population center of the region after the formation of the Old Indip Empire, this area depopulated quickly after the establishment of Drimmharbor. Now economically depressed, though home to some interesting architecture and a cultural center of traditional Indipian crafts. Considered a pass-through region by most Imperials.
2. __Drimmharbor District__. Officially the modern capital district of Indip, though many forget it is not an Imperial province in itself. Home to roughly 80% of the total population of Indip, and virtually all of the Human population.
3. __Ivëénland__ (farmlands and wetlands on the southern Indipian coast, named for the Iveéndip River). Historically important to the Old Indip Empire as a buttress against the Orcs of the Rock Hills, it is now rural in character, though far more accesible than the East Indip Expanse.
4. __East Indip Expanse__. The vast interior of Isndip, "expanding" to the Gold Desert). Civilian law does not apply here, and historically the Empire's touch has been very light.

Additionally, within the borders of Indip is __The Palace of the Pointed Crown__, an ancient sovereign enclave surrounded by Indipian lands. It is included here for convenience, but it is not legally or geopolitically part of Indip (similar to the Vatican City within Rome).

### 1. The Mulmarch 

Home to the Capital of Old Indip, Indïdip. Currently economically depressed and very sparesely populated outside of Indïdip and the other villages near Lake Mulloch.

### 2. Drimmharbor District

By far the most populous and economically important of modern Indip's sub-regions. The Drimmharbor District is also the site of the most ancient settlements in Indip, though its population remained small until the founding of Drimmharbor after Old Indip's takeover by Ashenstone.

- __Drimmharbor__ - capital, site of the Royal Navy Yards, the Royal Navy Academy, and home to the headquarters of the famously flamboyant _Lighthousers Guild_, one of the rare organizations politically savvy enough to have a strong presence in both Imperial and non-Imperial provinces.
- __Drimmharbor Quays__ - Navy operated satellite city of Drimmharbor. Site of the vast imperial drydocks and manufactories. The area is under strict martial law at all times. Rigorous system of checkpoints prevents unauthorized entry despite its massive size. Notably absent of Orcs and half-orcs. In recent years, vast shipments of enormous logs have been reported, though officials maintain silence on the matter.
- __Drez'Dip__ - "Near deepwater" - Half-orcs were historically pushed out of the areas immediately surrounding Drimmharbor, their claimed ur-heimat, and as such the largest Half-orc town remaining in Indip is __Drez'dip__, on the Northern coast of the Inbay. Expanded fishing rights granted in reforms of recent decades have slightly improved the fortunes of the population, but there is still much poverty and resentment.
- __Inpoint__ - a very wealthy beach town dominated by Naval Academy elites. Opulent.
- __Cape Drimm__ - a small but popular destination for relaxation and hobby fishing. Fresh seafood caught daily by human and half-orc fishermen. Despite existing road and land access, most visit by boat to avoid the activity and checkpoints around the Quays. Private sea-side roads lead directly here from __Inpoint__.
- __Ashwatch Point__ - a small but elegant town across the Great Indip Sound from Drimmharbor. Site of the Ashwatch Lighthouse, pride of the Lighthouser's Guild. The Ashwatch Lighthouse houses an observatory from which the Lighthousers claim they can view both the stars and the towers of Ashenstone across the Jewel Waters.

### 3. Invëénland

Inveenland, also called Invëye, was a critical region to Old Indip, despite its relative obscurity today. The oldest permanent settlements here are attributed to the Humans of Old Indip. Centered around the Bay of Invëye, Invëénland was both the economic and military center of the Middle Indipian Empire, and its regional capital, __Great Invëye__ so far outpaced the size, population, military presence, and economic output of the old capital of __Indïdip__ that it was often considered the capital despite never being formally decreed as such. Despite having largely decayed by the time of the Kaldrinic Empire's rise, it is said that Ashenstone set its sites on Indip so early on during its conquests lest some other power claim the right to the glory of Old Indip and its jewel, __Great Invëye__.

It's hard to overstate the threat that Old Indip felt from the Orcs of the Rock Hills. If Half-orcs were holy to the humans of Old Indip, Orcs were the very opposite, considered accursed. To be fair to the Old Indipians, The Orcs of the Rock Hills waged centuries of apparently unprovoked war against both the semi-nomadic Half-orcs and the Humans who considered them their sacred ward. To this effect, Old Indip constructed one of the great wonders of the pre-Kaldrinic world: __The Watergates__, four leviathan floating fortresses imbued with long forgotten magics. Combined with the large __Southfort__ and the __Great Trenches__ (Eastrench and Westrench), the very geography of South Invëénland was fortified against threats from the Rock Hills and beyond, whether by land or by sea.

### The Indip Expanse

![indip expanse](images/maps/indip_expanse.png)

Even today, most citizens of the Ashenstone Empire know little about the vast interior of Indip, despite its long inclusion under Imperial Dominion. The boundaries of the Expanse are not strictly definied, but it's safe to say that virtually all lands east of Lake Mulhong running south to the Rock Hills (and even as far West as __Flaa__ and the terminus of the __Eastrench__) can be included in its general area. It is said by the Elves that Forests of immense stature and unknowable age once stood in gorges carved by the headwaters of the Invëéndip and Chalice Rivers. From the __Palace of the Pointed Crown__, technically within the Indip Expanse, no such forests are visible from the expansive southern vistas, but rumors persist that some remnants may still be found.

The Indip Expanse is very rarely visited by humans, unless the __Palace of the Pointed Crown__ is included. The Empire maintains a policy of non-settlement, though in practice this only legally applies to Humans. Elves, Half-elves, and Half-orcs are said to make up the majority of the population, but no official records are kept.

## History
The region now known to the Kaldrinic Empire as "Indip" was previously part of the Old Indipian Empire, and before that, a site of two waves of Half-orc migrations. It is said the lands were also important to the Elves, but most cosmopolitan elvish communities report not knowing much about Indip.

Indip is a Kaldrinic shortening of Old Indipian _Ley-Indip-Ley_, "Great Land of Indip," or literally "Land of Indip Land,"  _Ley-Indip-Ley_ is itself a corruption of the much older half-orc name _Lz Ïndip'ey Ah_, or "Beside Deepwater [that is] Ours, Clear". Thus, the word _Ïndip_ means literally "Deepwater," likely referring to the small crater-sea now called the __Inbay__, the deepest known waters in the Empire.  

(_Yå'lv_, for the curious, is the word for shallow water ("waist-wet"), the old Half-Orc language having no word simply "water," using instead the word _Gerz'lv_ meaing "life-wet" for water that is imbibed.) This name _Lz Ïndip'ey Ah_ refers to the alleged home harbor of the Half-orcs, which Half-orc elders insist is now the site of the Drimmharbor Quays - a great travesty to their culture.

Historically, the region now know as Indip contained the largest population of Half-orcs, being at the crossroads of the Orc strongholds in the Rock Hills and the Human settlements in Mulhong. The vast majority of Half-orcs clearly came as refugees from the south and were gracefully incorporated into the Indipian empire which expanded out of the North. However, it is said that the first Half-orcs in recorded history originated from the area surroudning what is now Drimmharbor, and the refugees came seeking this even more ancient refuge once more, and that some very old lineages of half-orc lived there when the new wave of refugees arrived shortly before the dawn of the Old Indipian Empire. 

Half-orcs were generally respected members of the Indipian Empire, and while they were required to pay taxes and pay homage to the Fu-Indip-Ley ("First of Indip-Land", i.e. the Emperor), they were treated with respect by the Old Indipian Dynasties, who adapted the name of the Half-orc settlement (not in appropriation, but in homage) and considered them holy people. After the fall of the old Indipian Empire to the Kaldrinic Empire, the rights of half-orcs diminished steadily. Over four centuries of Imperial dominion, humans have replaced much of the naturalized and native Half-Orc population, at least on the coast, though sizeable "uncontacted" half-orc populations are said to exist in the poorly surveyed interior, themselves said to be either remnants of the original native Half-orcs or rewilded bands of Half-orc refugees fleeing Imperial persecution. 

Elves, while historically a transient presence in the lands now known as Indip, are increasingly plentiful, both on the coast and in the interior, and seem not to have suffered much under the Empire. In recent decades, rumors of large-scale logging for the Empire's navy (the Empire is famously secretive as to where it sources raw materials), have soured the Elves, Half-elves, and Half-orcs even in places like Drimmharbor and Drez-dip, far from the alleged extractions. Complicating this outrage is the claim by Imperial Foresters that no great forestlands exist in Indip - the Forests directly East, North, and South of the Drimmharbor district are relatively small in area and well visited by hunters, recreators, and foragers, all whom report no notable disturbances.

In present times, the quality of life for Humans (and for many Elves and Half-elves) in the Drimmharbor area ranks among the highest in the Empire, especially among the well-educated elite affiliated with the Drimmharbor Naval Academy and Imperial Navy. Thus, despite a burgeoning movement of resentful nature-lovers and tree-worshippers, public support for the Empire is arguably higher in the cosmpolitan population of Indip than even in Ashenstone itself. It is said that to find Ashenstone's most loyal subjects, look to Drimmharbor rather than Ashestone.
