## History
The Jewel Sea is the geographic heart of the Kaldrinic Empire, who use their naval prowess to exert easy control over the imperial provinces bordering the sea. Since the landing of the Kaldrinic Dynasty on the shores of what is now Ashenstone, the sea has been under the near complete dominion of imperial forces. The various kingdoms, petty states, lords, and pirates who once clashed, stole, and looted throughout the sea were quickly subdued under the naval supremecy of the Kaldrinic forces. What few pirates remain make their homes on the small, more remote islands in the sea and rarely last long before being rooted out by Kaldrinic Marines in the name of securing safe trade and transportation across the water.

During the reign of the Kaldrinic Empire, all islands from which the mainland or Ekryp are not visible are under the direct authority of the Imperial Throne rather than any of the surrounding provinces. The exception to this is the semi-autonomous Chanrithi Republic between the shores of Ekryp and Denrylak, which must respond to the commands of the throne in many affairs but is allowed to manage domestic affair and many laws per their own leadership.

## Geography
The eastern expanse of the sea is generally shallow and sandy. To the west, the sea bed drops off and the shorelines become rockier. Throughout the sea are hundreds of islands, ranging from small rocky outcrops with only a few shrubs to large islands that once constituted entire kingdoms, like the ancient island Kingdom of Henthruin.
