We find the last of the five crates.  
We learn that Ilya the previous warehouse manager had been disposed of. as well as the shipping ledger.

A guard from outside comes, but Lightsong uses two cantrips for the party to flee.

The party goes back to Thorvir's and everyone gets 200 Gold Pieces. Thorvir gives the group a new quest - figure out what's inside of the large marked crate, or better, steal the crate and bring it back to him. Thorvir reveals that the Lord Chakri (Lightsong seems particularly interested with violence in his heart) sent the large crate to Lord Tiersen Korak (father of lord Ewyin Korak). 

The group argues about the ethics of killing bad guys vs unconfirmed bad guys.
Lightsong makes peace with the dwarves but still kinda doesn't like Flim Flam.

## Day 3

### Morning - Preparing

The party goes to Lighthammer the smith's shop to buy some weapons and armor.  
We bought some weapons and armor. 

Now they travel two hours by foot to the beach near Korak estate.

Lightsong finds a signet ring that he gives to Flim-Flam.
The group splits up! Lightsong agrees to make peace with Flim Flam.

Thorin and Hazar find a cave with a ladder up to the estate, though nobody takes it yet. It's not clear where in the estate the ladder leads.


### Midday - Infiltrating the Korak Estate

Hazar disguises with Lightsong's kit and goes into the Korak estate via the front gate, bypassing the ladder, as Lord Jerald Thrin (someone Hazar just happened to know might have dealings with Koraks) and takes a Bardic Inspiration.
He meets with a guard and haughtily asks to be taken to see the shipment.

The steward brings Hazar to Lord Tiersen Korak. 
Hazar (disguised as Jeral) throws the doors open.
He gets into a situation where the Lord and Lady are seeing through his disguise, and then they call the Lord Chakri who confirms lord Jeral Thrin has been thrown into jail.

Hazar is escorted by guards downstairs, but manages to trick them into letting him see a horse, which he steals and whom he absconds with to safety.

### Afternoon - Regrouping; Boudicca Returns

We are in front of the mouth of the cave deciding what to do next.

A stocky figure runs toward the party! Who is it? It's Boudicca! Hooray!
