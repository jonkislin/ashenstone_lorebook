They find a cave with a ladder up to the estate, though nobody takes it yet. It's not clear where in the estate the ladder leads.


#### Infiltrating the Korak Estate

Hazar disguses with Lightsong's kit and goes into the Korak estate via the front gate, bypassing the ladder, as Lord Jerald Thrin and takes a Bardic Inspiration.
He meets with a guard and haughtily asks to be taken to see the shipment.

The steward brings Hazar to Lord Tiersen Korak.

He gets into a situation where the Lord and Lady are seeing through his disguise, and then they call the Lord Chakri who confirms lord Jeral Thrin has been thrown into jail.
