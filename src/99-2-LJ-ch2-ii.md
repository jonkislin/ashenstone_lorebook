Where were we?

### (Still) At the Lighthouser's Outpost, in Coastream

_Furdae, Aprel 15th, 442 KE_

Eolebiad, the Poison Master, has some poisions!
Shit, they're way too pricey. I'm going to sit this one out.

I'm going to write Grenna:

```txt
Dear Grenna,

I have a moment to myself (have you come across the Lighthouser's in your travels?) and I thought "shant I write the lovely Grenna?"

I still seek news of the Mute Sickness, but Laighfu√§r seems not to have been afflicted.Please, if you hear of anything, let me know.

I send to you these silver earrings - they reflect light much like do your eyes.
Drat, that was corny. 

Our party goes now into danger, perhaps. 
Steer clear of Chakri's men, and tell no one you know of me, or of us. 

Yours, 
Lightsong

Looks like Boudicca and the lovely idiot whom we call Hazar spent too much money. 
That was harsh. I'm growing quite fond of the noble, I dare say.

I play a ditty for Eolbiod. Curse that spelling. And Boudicca's de-strengthenging poison is gotten for a mere 500 gold.

We leave, with Thurysso in tow, for better or worse.

### Back down to the Wharf and the Old Man/Dinghy

Doran the Boat Man! He is old. The same old guy. He gave his name! It's Dora! I mean Doran. Or do I?

### From the Docks of Estwick to the Lostweave
I tell Thurysso that if he proves his worth to the group, a Rapier+1 may be in his future. 
Torin susses out this fool and finds out he's yeah, pretty weak. (Ran a medicine check)

The Wonderful Immaculate Spectacular Gryffin. A Positive Adjective Gryffin.
A little worse for wear? But! A Healthy size crowd mingles in front. 

Across the street, about a decade (or decal) of city guards (there's 10 of them.)

Hazar is blabbering again. Something about robbing? I don't really know.  
Some dwarves, elves, gnomes, and even humans. Mostly dwarves. Have we found CODA (the Coalition of Dwarven Artisans)?
