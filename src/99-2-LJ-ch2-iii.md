Hazar peels Jenniquean's kneecap off.. What The Fuck. I heal it... or try to, but it doesn't work. *\*illegible scrabblings\**

We leave Jenniquean Wreath with the guards and head back to the Lizard Bachelor.
Thurysso was saying shit about how he was meeting with an old "friend" while we were fighting.
Boudicca wins some gold. Man I'm sleepy. Some lady gave me 10 silver?

Sharing a room with Torin. He is emitting WARMTH. He's a bit slimy and crusty at the same time, if that were possible.

## _Early Morning, Kaaterday, Aprel 16th, 443 KE._

I should not have shared a bed with the Dwarfman... time for a bath!
They draw one up for us.

I hear Hazar talking with Shaheila out in the main room.  
Something about holding hands? What the heck is going on there.  
Torin passes me the soap. Man, we are GROSS.

After a good clean and laundering, Hazar tells us that Councillor Jerrick may grant us susccor in our time of need.
Where's that Horse Henry?

Hazar hands Nommy the Stableboy a freaking PLATINUM. WHAT. WHAT. WHAT.   
\**Lightsong writes WHAT for another seventeen or so times\**.

We all go forward to Jerrick's gardens up in Woodorks, along with Shaheila.

Hazar is asking me to use my fabled Thaumaturgy on something... then Boudicca breaks open the outer gate? Okay.

Shaheila says her relationship with Jerrick goes back a decade.
We approach the main door, and things seem quiet too quiet.

My Wanderer's Shortbow points back 10 feet away from the House.
I let slip something about Ekryp. Jeez. I have to watch my tongue. I do respect my compatriots, but I'm not ready to give everything up yet. 

I send some Dancing Lights in after Torin, he says "some shit went down."
Hmm. 

I think I will keep entries organized by days going forward.

I send a Light-figure to the far door, where it shimmers. 
And Boudicca's servant opens the door, which causes the door to shoot lightning at ti. The lightnigh fizzles, as it does as Boudicca walks through. I KNEW this was a trap.

Katherina and Nicalous sent letters to Jerrick. Boudicca pockets the letters. Jeez, she really likes stealing doesn't she...

We hear screaming upstairs, and we go up. A pressure plate triggers under my feet, which turns the stairs into a veritable slide! What now! Bouddica and I tumble into the basement.
