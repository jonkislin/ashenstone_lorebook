# Lightsong's Journal

## Thyrsday, Aprel 14th, 442

My salubrious companions and I decided to accompany Hawk Vorplen to his 
mistress, Cherri, who had sent us toward Hawk and the Lizard Bachelor.

My fellow squisher, Flim Flam, is quite exhausted at this point. I was too, you know.
We get back to the Elm Snake and chat with the bouncer shortly and jovially before
he lets us in.

### Cherri's Place at the Elm Snake
- Girish Grog. Half orc.
- Hawk Vorplen.
- Cherri gives us 10 platinum a piece.
