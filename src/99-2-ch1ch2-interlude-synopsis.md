# Interlude One - From Crag to Taynuilt

## Day One
- Hazar becomes very ill. Shaheila watches over him. 
- Flim-flam and Torin begin to spar (friendly!).
- Boudicca collects bets from the ship-folk.
- Torin wins and Boudicca skims profits from the bets (28g!)
- Beautiful clear sky, the two prongs pointing north and the red coil. 
- New moons for both moons.

## Day Two
- We meet Grenna. Lightsong asks about the Mute Sickness. 
    - She and Swinner met an old man who talked about it after a hunting accident. 
- We rescue Therisso Green of Ashenstone (Bard) from a small boat in the water. He has a nice lute, seemingly intact.
    - (And a big hat, of course. Probably same size as Pop Cornwallis III)

## Day Three
- Boudicca questions Captain Pop Cornwallis III on time. We're ahead of schedule. Still good weather.
- Nothing else happened

## Day Four
- Halfway through Day Four, Grenna sees something out on the horizon.
- Another ship comes due towards us. 
- The Empire. They come in peace... or so they say. 
- Inspecting ship. Lightsong rolls a whole bunch of lucky deception and persusasion rolls.
- Inspection ship says they want Therisso Green. Lightsong says he's Lord Major Greenwater of Drimmharbor. He stole the Xun Tome of Hiro Drimm, or so Lightsong says, and there's nothing to see here. Jedi mind trick used.
- The inspection ship sails away. Lightsong is so lucky.
