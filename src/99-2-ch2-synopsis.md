    - He will ask us to join him on his dinghy.
- Go through the entryways

#### Buying things along the way
- Hazar buys Blade of Dusk (dagger on the longer side of things - for backstabbing, perhaps!)

-- Session One ends --

#### In Cherry's Lair

- We convince Cherry to get us 18 gold a piece.
- We get Boudicca in from the bar to collect her gold, because Hazar rolled a 2 on persuasion.
- Cherry has a task for us. An associate, Hawk Vorplen. We gotta shake him up. He's skimming profits. 
- Cherry's office building is The Demon Lender. 
- The Elm Snake in Palace-Stead - that's his favorite bar. If we don't find him at the office.
    - House in Wall Brook.

#### Back in the Bar

- We met Herman and T.F. (Nick and Rajan one-off characters)
- We invite them to journey with us this one time.

#### Walking to Lostweave, the Weapon Shop
- We were in Estwick, at the wall... we need to find a gate.
- We come across guards and a portcullis to the upper city.
- We notice rogues in the new city.
- T.F.'s insight tells us we were smart not to corner them in an alleyway.
- We enter the shop.
- Flim Flam charms the Shopkeep (he's Genie the Wuldan btw, which Lightsong and Torin speak).
- Lightsong gets the Bow of the Wanderer (shortbow +1, I can shoot arrows in the air and they will land in the direction I need to go)
- Axe of Cleaving for Torin.
- Cunneke would know about the Blade of Dusk. 

#### Checking out Hawk Vorplen

- My Shortbow of the Wanderer suggests we go to the Elm Snake in Palace-Stead.
