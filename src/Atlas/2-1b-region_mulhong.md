## Summary
Mulhong is a diverse province that encompasses the historic lands of many different kingdoms and people that predate the establishment of the Imperial province. As a result, governing Mulhong is less centralized than some other provinces. Instead of a designated provincial seat, administration is through system of assistant governors who specialize in the customs and laws of each subregion, or "March". The central governor traditionally calls Northanchor home, but some have opted to reside in other portions of Mulhong or even outside the province. 

## Marches of Mulhong
Imperial adminstration of Mulhong is divided into seven distinct provicial divisions, or "Marches".

1. __Mulmarch__. Mulmarch is an agricultural region along the southwest border of Mulhong, extending south to the border of [Indip](2-1a-region_indip.md) and west to the Rift Water. Though it shares a namesake with __The Mulmarch__ in Indip, the region only shares loose ties with the region to the south. The Mul River which forms the border acted as a natural border that limited the expansion of the ancient nomadic Huldi people who expanded into this portion of Mulhong and after centuries of immersion with the indigenous people become the Mul culture extant prior to Kaldrinic incursion.

During the age of the Old Indipian Empire, this region was considered one of the core regions of the Empire prior to rebelling in -206 K.E., part of the string of events that destabalised the Northern Indipian Empire. Following freedom from Indipian control, the [Second Kingdom of Mul](./1-2-nation_Mul.md) was established under the rebellion's leader, Czerk Hritte Lan I. This Kingdom was never very powerful but lasted until the arrival of the Kaldrinic Empire and fell in 10 K.E. in a relatively peaceful agreement.

Kaldrinic administration of the Mulmarch is out of the historic capital of the Kingdom of Mul, Brintze.

2. __Gritia Plains__. The Gritia Plains encompasses the western reaches of Mulhong. Once the core of the Taynish kingdom of Gritia, the plains are a gently rolling expanse of plains dotted with wooded upland outcrops. During the time of the Kingdom of Gritia, the region was well populated along the fertile broad river valleys. Following the burning of the capital city of Sarreff in 156 K.E. and the destruction of the ruling houses, the region fell into chaos and disorder. Without the protection and investment of the local nobility much of the population fled either west into Lynnla or south into Mulmarch or Indip.

After a tumultuous few decades and attempts of the remaining Gritian nobility to remain in control of the frayed Kingdom, the Treaty of Five Crowns was signed in 221 K.E. Though the treaty protected some level of autonomy for the other Taynish Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Gritia was divided. Lands east of the Absou River were turned over to absolute Kaldrinic control, while those west were absorbed into Lynnla. The northern parts of the Plains were later placed under adminstration of Northgrit.

By the 400s, the Gritia Plains remained only sparsely populated with most larger settlements centered around major trade crossroads or major military outposts. Many ruins of the old Kingdom of Gritia remain throughout the region, including the haunted shell of Sarreff. Kaldrinic administration of the Gritia Plains is out of the small city of Threniss.

3. __Northgrit__. In the lower lying break between the Greenrock Mountains and the Delzherni Range lies the lands of Northgrit. Here the moisture of Korren Sea and change of geomorphology change from the plains and moors of central Mulhong allow the land to be covered in thick forests. Between the rugged and cliff filled uplands are wide, flat river valleys flowing north to the sea.

Most settlements during the Kaldrinic Empire are concentrated on the valley edges, though in the uplands are the remains of older, more ancient settlements.

Northgrit was divided administratively from the Gritia Plains following the establishemnt of [Northanchor](./2-2f-city_Northanchor.md), which continued to serve as the administrative and economic center of the March for the entirety of Kaldrinic control.

4. __Delzher-Naha__. Spreading out from the southern edge of the imposing Delzherni Range and across the central plains of Mulhong lies the March Delzher-Naha, named after the broad shallow lake around which most of the March's major settlements lie. The foothills of the mountains to the north are fed by snowy mountain run off and have vast expanses of conifer forests. The lower lands to the south flatten out to the characteristic plains and broad river valleys of central Mulhong.

Lake Naha sits in the center of the March in a shallow depression in the land, rumored by inhabitants to be the ancient washbowl of the gods. Due to the shallow nature and minimal rainfall in the plains themselves, the lake level flucuates significantly with the spring meltwater off the mountains, with the shore in some places moving miles out towards the lake center in dry years. Though this inhibited the lake's use for boat trade, a unique method of irrigating fields built along the lake shore allowed the region to produce copious amounts of rice.

Kaldrinic administration of the March is out of Trongyaree on the north shore of Lake Naha, the ancient regligious pilgrimage city for the Huldi people.

5. __Honglivon__. Most of central plains of Mulhong bounded by the Mul and Wide Rivers is considered part of the Honglin March. 

Kaldrinic administration of Honglivon is out of Ryagstiv on the Mul River.

6. __Kormarch__. Once part of Korren, Kormarch was added to Mulhong in 311 K.E. at the conclusion of the first Korren Civil War as part of the peace agreement. Later when the Kingdom of Korren was brought under Imperial control, Kormarch remained a part of Mulhong in order to keep the puppet kingdom weak. By the dissolution of the Kingdom of Korren, most people had forgotten Kormarch was ever a part of Korren so it remained under the jurisdiction of the Mulhong Governors.

Kaldrinic administration of the Mulmarch is out of ancient mountain fortress of Thrunivkyr in the eastern reaches of the Delzherin Range.

7. __Longmarch__. It is said that the name for Longmarch comes from the Imperial Legions tasked with travelling through the region to establish Kaldrinic control, only to find nothing more than long days of marching. According to Kaldrinic scholars, the name actually derives from the leader of the local Orcish warlord, Longzi Roool, who "sold" the lands to the Kaldrinic conquerers for a hefty sum only to have Longzi continue to raid and plague the Kaldrinic outposts for decades before finally dying in a duel against the new, young Provincial Governor Thi Gyar in 54 K.E.

There are very few permanent settlements of note in Longmarch. Most are mining communities, military outposts, or frontier trading posts that exchange goods with the nomadic half-orc and Huldi still living in and to the east of the region. Kaldrinic administration of the Long march is out of Fort Sunto on the Wide River, joking considered by legionnaires posted in the region as "the closest to sunrise civilization can go".
