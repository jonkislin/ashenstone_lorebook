- Dr Stone is dropped off at the Crooked Cornucopia with the barkeep - Pringle.
- Tinker's Shop - we get a pouch with powders and cartridges...
    - Incendiary Round kit for Dr Stone. Every long rest, it recharges. 
    - Can be used to craft 3 incendiary rounds. Can only hold up to 3 on a person at a time.
- At the urging of Tinker, we talk to Shifty in the Cornucopia who recoounts a journey to the desert and his possessed friend Steve.
