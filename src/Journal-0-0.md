> _For A - May you sing again._

The following are my notes on my travels starting in 443 K.E. I don't know what struck me to start formally recording events at this stage, maybe it's because my companions grew a bit more stable for once.   

Or maybe because I, for once, have some hope of Justice being brought to bear on that Beast and his vile progeny.
