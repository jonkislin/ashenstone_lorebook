| Controller   | Charlotte           |
| Impressions  | _Generally good natured, but she is willing to kill... perhaps too willing. She has done right by me though, and I owe my life to her a few times over. She is strong, and wields the powers of Death. I am glad to count her as an ally._ |

| Age          | 28                   |
| Controller   | Mike                 |
| Impressions and notes  | _I did not like him at all at first - I could tell he was a noble (formerly, anyway) on first sight, and I swear I've seen him Ashenstone in the ritzier districts. However, I was impressed by his restraint in the Warehouses of Crag, and I have grown fond of him, despite our bickering. Very curious to find out he was once a lighthouser - this has elevated my opinion of him quite a bit, despite the apparent fall from Grace he and the other Lighthousers allude to. He shares in our goal to bring down the Beast of Ashenstone, Chakri, and for him it is also personal. I wonder what other secrets he nurtures._|

| Impressions  | _He could fight a boulder and win. I am truly happy he's on my side. He has shown me kindness, but I am more the distraught by the corpses he has left mangled in his wake, especially with that cursed Axe of his. He can show restraint when need be, and has listened to my counsel._ |
