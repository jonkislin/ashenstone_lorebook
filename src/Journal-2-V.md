## _Early Afternoon, Kaaterday, Aprel 16th, 443KE_

Well, let's see what's in this armory now that those enhanted cuirasses have been dismantled...

I pull from the wall:
- __Ancient Ekryptian Shortsword__

Darn pulls from a case:
- __Morningstar of the Fallen Mountain__
    - Goes to Boudicca

I feel bad that Darn has been shafted after ogling the Morningstar, so I give him the Ancient Ekryptian Shortsword. I'm going to open the next display case, Darn gets poisoned by dart... and then attacks me with the Ancient Ekryptian Shortword! What gives! Ouch! Thanks to Torin, he is once again crumpled on the floor. 

We use a mage hand and Steve the Unseen Servant to open the remaining cases:

- __Tome of Wizard Wishes__
    - Goes to Flim Flam
- __Gloves of the Fire Warden__
    - Goes to Hazar.

### The Upstairs Study?
In the next room, we find a woman, Clarice, under a net. We interrogate her, she's also under Gordro's employ. I cut out Clarice from under the net, and Torin smacks me! Ouch!!!

I go numb and sit on the floor with my lute.

Boudicca has three bronze rings? Dang. She's incorrigible. The elves of Kiv'La would've had her hands by now many time over.

Scrolls? I suppose I have a taste for this 'looting' thing myself. What's becoming to us here? Are we even on the right path? Morally speaking? Who are we? Grandfather would have never approved. 


### Clarice and the Poison Mist

Clarice opens a door and a poison gas fills the room. I am done with this. Healing myself up, I run up the stairs and cast dancing lights.

Up through a side room on the left, back through into a hallway, then through and a bollo wraps around my legs. 

### Jerrick Thorkalen and Gordro

Jerrick points a sword at me and asks who I am. I call his name and he is startled that I know it. 

Torin comes through, I tell him to put down his axe. Then Shaheila comes in and diffuses the situation. My bollo is removed. 

We share wine and speech. 

Jerrick tells us:
- He thought Shaheila and her son were dead.
- Chakri. How do we stop it. 
- He has Chakri's itinerary.

### Chakri's Itinerary

__Wegsdae Morning:__
- Chakri arrives.

__Wegsdae Afternoon:__
- In the Copper Keep with the Dutchess
- Holy mass of the Mother
- Cathedral on far side of bay.

__Wegsdae Evening:__
- Dinner with the Knights of the Valley.
- After-dinner, private appointment.

__Thyrsdae__:
- Military parade
- Sunset Mass at the Pantheon of the Family
- Evening gala at the Belt Theatre

Jerrick will put in a good word with ol Sir Darley Farlin.

## _Late Afternoon, Kaaterday, Aprel 16th, 443KE_

We leave for the Lizard Bachelor and take a long rest, where I am writing this now.

We go to bed.
