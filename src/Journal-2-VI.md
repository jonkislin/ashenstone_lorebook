- We debate, in the Lizard Bachelor, how best to kill him. The beast that has haunted us. We've almost got him!
- My mind continues to be hazy. What is this? I must be in better shape...
- Marquil, the right hand mand of the beast, is coming Monday to scout ahead. 

The Elf wizard suggests a plan:
- Start a riot in the main town, Wednesday night, city hall. 
- Once some portion of the army moves into the city, blow it up half way. 
- We are meanwhile undercover in the castle. 
- Hazar suggests we use a proxy. 

_We go to sleep for the night_

Cherri wakes Torin and I up. 
Yuwelion and Grenlo walk in. We wake up the rest of the party and beckon them in. 

What might they want?

Aha! I am given a necklace of Regeneration. This should come in handy.
