It is the day. The day we slay the beast, Ylysir Chakri. 

## __Wenzday Morning__

### Heading out for the day

We have a spot of banter in the morning. Hazar and I argue the ethics of spilling brains and peeling back kneecaps.

Ancient trees along the boulevard! How lovely. 

As we walk toward the Southern Half of the city, the distinct stream of imperial soldiers greets us... not Chakri's men, perhaps, but here because of his machinations. 

Well, my companions Hazar and Torin are truly making a word salad of this interaction with the guards. 

### Meeting at the Copper Keep

Yes, we are back in the small tunnel. Loric will meet us soon. 
The Beast. His presence. I feel it. It approaches.

We are in the tunnels now. Dusty bottles abound. Torin grabs one, opens it, and takes a swig.
I... wouldn't have advised that. 

Thirty bottles! My party members take some, interesting I suppose. 

Boudicca and I perform a blood oath - I will not heal anyone but our fellows. Ouch.
Hazar keeps running his mouth about this Willem guard. I don't think I ever quite paid attention. 

Passages within the walls of the Copper Keep. 

#### Beat Bastard Ylisir's schedule
1. He arrives
2. Spends a few hours with the Dutchess

#### The stones from Shaheila
Loric gives us each a matte black stone with a dancing schedule. Each make a Lynnish ensemble.

Cryth, Bagpipe, Sham - oboe like thing, Drum, Harp.

We must find out what happened to her son. 

## __Wenzday Afternoon__

#### Through the castle to find a better weapon

Short bow tells me I will find a good weapon. Northeast. First floor.

We bribe the guard. Sort of. The rest isn't worth talking about. We have bigger fish to fry. 

Looks like we've killed an entire hour in the castle. 

#### Up to the top floor

I once again don't care about this man Willem. 
I see not why Hazar bothers him.

How might we escape? And where shall we lie in wait?
My blood boils, my blood stirs. 
May chaos take the world, and may it take Chakri first.
Down the storage room.

## __Wenzday Evening__

#### We hear the beast

I tell them of the time in the Forest. They deserve to know that at least.

Marquil is still alive and about. Drat.
We await. 

I squeak to investigate, but realize how I'm squeaking and come back. Hazar and Torin identify a guard... and dispatch him, fast. Too fast.

Block the spiral staircase - Bouddicca. 

Into the passageways.

We hear the beast talk to his man Marquil.
He almost drinks teh wine
Louissa Corrack. She led Chakri into Balnourial.
Chakri casts some unholy magicks against Louissa.
He slices Louissa's necklace.

"Only in Darkness can stars shine?"
Louissa to be one of his bright stars?
"I know the gifts we must accept"
What the FUCK is he doing to her?

"My lady, you've seen the darkness. You've seen its inevitability"

Oh. He has a thing for Louissa. 
He's... giving her some dark energy.
I HATE THIS MAN.

She grimaces at the name 'wildflower'.
I understand. This man believes himself above all. He believes all is justified. 

Interesting she doesn't refer to him by his first name. Ylisir. 
Too nice a name for too beastly a man. 

He took a swig of the poisoned wine.

It looks like the riot has begun...

Hazar takes the first leap out into Chakri.
HERE WE GO.

# Confronting the Beast, High Lord Ylisir Chakri

## In Charkri's Copper Keep Quarters
Well, it happened so fast but it seemed that we managed to kill him. 
Instead... though... we get sucked into the void.

## In the deep dark depths...

Boudicca tells us that this artificial, 
slightly bioluminescent tunnel, but this is very clearly a dwarven mine.

We reach a fork. Hmm.. I do see tracks leading to left.
The bow also points us toward the Left. Let us find our vengeance.
Torin does a gnarly parkour kickflip in the direction of the tracks... nice. 

We enter into a large room, very dark, running water.

How old must this old place be? I wonder. 
My compatriot Torin deduces that this looks far older than any Dwarven city, 
and this hasn't been maintained in perhaps centuries!

Boudicca tastes it. She says its wonderful.

Ohhh shit there is a screech. WHAT IS THAT! THERE ARE TWO.
